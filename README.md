# Intermediate HTML and CSS Projects

## Intermediate HTML and CSS Projects - Overview

This repository will include links to all projects of the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" course within "The Odin Project".

This repository was created after I completed the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" course, and its main goal is to give easy access to all projects done during the course including a short summary of what the projects include.

Please take note of each project's commit history; it is possible additional features (not in the scope of the original project) were added to a certain project; you can use the commit history (and the "README" file within each repository) to determine whether additional features (that weren't a part of the original project) were added to a project.

- ["Sign-Up Form" (Personal Design)](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/signup_project) - A personal twist to the above project, a sign up form with my own design.
